## **Kendrick mass plot**

### **Description**

:material-menu-open: **Visualization → Kendrick mass plot**

In 1963 Kendrick published his idea of a mass scale, the so-called Kendrick mass scale, which is based on defining the mass of CH2 as 14.0000 u.

The Kendrick mass scale is calculated by multiplying the IUPAC mass scale with the factor 14.0000 u/14.01565 u = 0.9988834. This results in the same mass defect for homologous components, the so-called **Kendrick mass defect (KMD)**. The KMD is defined as the \(\Delta\) of a nominal Kendrick mass and its associated Kendrick mass. Using the Kendrick mass scale has the purpose of data reduction.

\[KM(R)=m/z\cdot\frac{round(R)}{R}\]

\[KMD(R)=round(KM(R))-KM(R)\]

where \(KM\) is Kendrick mass, \(KMD\) - Kendrick mass defect, \(R\) - exact mass of selected base unit

### **Detailed functionality**

This module allows to create 2 and 3 dimensional Kendrick mass plots. All possible feature characteristics can be plotted in a third dimension.

#### **Charge dependent Kendrick mass plots**

Multiply charged ions can cause splits in Kendrick mass plot. Fouquet et al. have shown considering the charge for the calculation of the KM can help to overcome this problem through clustering of features.

\[KM(R,Z)=Z\cdot KM(R)=Z\cdot m/z\cdot \frac{round(R)}{R}\]

where \(Z\) is charge.

#### **Resolution enhanced Kendrick mass defect plots**

Fouquet and Sato have shown that a fractional base unit (ivisor) can enhance the resolution of Kendrick mass plots.

\[X>1, KM(R,X)=m/z\cdot \frac{round(R/X)}{R/X}\]

where \(X\) is a fractional base unit.

#### **Combining charge and fractional base unit (Divisor)**

If both charge and fractional base unit are changed, the following equation is used:

\[KM(R,Z,X)=Z\cdot KM(RX)=Z\cdot m/z\cdot \frac{round(R/X)}{R/X}\]

#### **Remainders of Kendrick masses (RKM)**

Another option to increase the resolution of Kendrick mass plots is the by Fouquet et al. proposed concept of RKM (remainders of Kendrick masses). By clicking the KMD/RKM button in the toolbar on the right side, KMDs are transformed to RKMs.

\[RKM(R)=\Bigg\{\frac{KM(R)}{round(R)}\Bigg\}\]

with \(\{ \}\) being the fractional part function defined as \(x=x-floor(x)\)

If you want to display a Kendrick mass defect on the x-axis, check the check box and enter a sum formula as Kendrick mass base.

#### **Z-axis value**

Select which parameters you want to display in the third dimension. If you select "none", a 2D Kendrick mass plot will be generated.

#### **Kendrick mass base for Z-Axis**

If you want to display a Kendrick mass defect on the z-axis in form of a heatmap, check the check box and enter a sum formula as Kendrick mass base.

#### **Z-axis scale value**

Choose the bounds for the Z-axis. "Percentile" allows to exclude values of a selected percentile bellow and/or above from the paint scale. Values below will be displayed in black, values above will be displayed in magenta. "Custom" allows to set custom ranges.

#### **Range for z-axis scale**

Enter lower bound left and higher bound right. If you have choosen percentile for Z-axis scale the values must be between 0 and 100. If you enter 0 and 100, all values will be included in the paint scale.

#### **Heatmap style**

Select the style of your paint scale. You can choose between rainbow and different monochrome color coded paint scales.

## **Van Krevelen diagram**

### **Description**

**Van Krevelen diagrams** are graphical plots developed by Dirk Willem van Krevelen (chemist and professor of fuel technology at the TU Delft) that are used to assess the origin and maturity of kerogen and petroleum. 

The diagram cross-plots the hydrogen:carbon (hydrogen index) as a function of the oxygen:carbon (oxygen index) atomic ratios of carbon compounds.
