# Welcome to the MZmine 3 wiki!

MZmine 3 is an open-source, platform-independent software for mass spectrometry (MS) data
processing and visualization. It enables large-scale metabolomics and lipidomics research by
spectral preprocessing, feature detection, and various options for compound identification,
including spectral library querying and creation.

Since the introduction of MZmine 2 in 2010, the project has matured into a community-driven, highly
collaborative platform and its functions continue to expand based on the users' needs and feedbacks.
This has also enabled the tight integration of the MZmine ecosystem with popular third-party
software for MS data analysis, such as
the [SIRIUS](https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/) suite for _in silico_ metabolite
annotation, the [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp?redirect=auth)
platform, the [MetaboAnalyst](https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/)
web app for univariate and multivariate statistical anlysis, _etc._ Such a great progress was made possible by the invaluable contribution of
many [developers](https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine3/graphs/contributors) from research labs
distributed all over the world!

## About this documentation

Here you can find documentation for both processing and visualization modules in MZmine 3. Moreover,
data processing pipelines for untargeted [LC-MS](workflows/lcmsworkflow/lcms-workflow.md)
and [LC-IMS-MS](workflows/imsworkflow/ion-mobility-data-processing-workflow.md) feature detection
are described and general recommendations are given.

**COMING SOON!** We are currently working on a series of short videotutorials to help get you
started with the main features of MZmine 3!

## What's new compared to MZmine 2?

MZmine 3 comes with a redesigned and fully customizable [GUI](getting_started/main-window-overview.md) based on the
JavaFX technology that allow an interactive visualization and validation of results from every
processing step.

A completely new data structure provides the flexibility to process any type of mass spectrometry,
including LC-MS, GC-MS and MS-imaging. Moreover, MZmine 3 now supports ion mobility, with a
dedicated [LC-IM-MS data visualization](visualization_modules/ims_raw_data_overview/IM-data-visualisation.md)
module and [feature detection](workflows/imsworkflow/ion-mobility-data-processing-workflow.md)
algorithms.

Finally, significant effort was devoted to trace memory issues and bottlenecks, resulting in an
unprecendent processing performance and scalability.

The latest changelog can be found [here](acknowledgements/changelog.md)!

**COMING SOON!** We are implementing
the [Mass Spec Query Langauge](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/SpectraQL) (MassQL) to
explore your MS data with human-readable, succinct queries! The project is suppported by
the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program.
