# Welcome to the MZmine 3 wiki!

MZmine 3 is an open-source, platform-independent software for mass spectrometry data
processing and visualization. Here you can find documentation for both processing and visualization modules in MZmine 3. Moreover,
data processing pipelines for untargeted [LC-MS](workflows/lcmsworkflow/lcms-workflow.md)
and [LC-IMS-MS](workflows/imsworkflow/ion-mobility-data-processing-workflow.md) feature detection
are described and general recommendations are given. New to MZmine 3? [Get started](./getting_started/index.md)!

!!! note ""

    When using the MZmine software, please cite the following paper:<br>
    Robin Schmid, Steffen Heuckeroth, Ansgar Korf et al. Integrative analysis of multimodal mass spectrometry data in MZmine 3. _**Nature Biotechnology**_ (2023), DOI: [10.1038/s41587-023-01690-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01690-2).

!!! tip "**COMING SOON!**"

    We are implementing the [Mass Spec Query Langauge](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/SpectraQL) (MassQL) to explore your MS data with human-readable, succinct queries! The project is suppported by the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program..

## How to contribute

Over the years, thanks to community efforts and collaboration with other open-source projects, MZmine has become one of the most popular tools for visualising and analysing untargeted MS data.
It enables large-scale metabolomics and lipidomics research by
spectral preprocessing, feature detection, and various options for compound identification,
including spectral library querying and creation.

You can contribute by
improving existing modules or even adding new featurs to MZmine 3. Please, check out our
brief [tutorial](http://mzmine.github.io/development.html). You can also contribute to this wiki and help new users to get started with MZmine 3.
See [here](contribute/contribute.md) how to contribute to the documentation.
