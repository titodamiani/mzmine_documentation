# Ion identity networking

:material-menu-open: **Feature list methods → Feature grouping → Ion identity networking** 

Annotates grouped features (same retention time + optionally, feature shape and height correlation) as ion adducts, in 
source fragments, and multimers. Also used as input to the [Ion Identity Molecular Networking workflow]
(https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/fbmn-iin/) on GNPS. Searches all feature pairs against an ion library 
for each possible combination.

## Parameters
![IIN dialog](dialog.png)


#### _m/z_ tolerance
Intra sample _m/z_ tolerance describes the difference between two ions of the same molecule at the same retention 
time. This tolerance is usually very small and depends on the mass resolution. Orbitrap instruments for example 3 ppm.

#### Check
- **ONE FEATURE**: Only one feature needs to match (_m/z_ difference within one sample) 
- **ALL FEATURES**: All features need to match (_m/z_ difference within ALL samples) 
- **AVERAGE**: Matches the _m/z_ difference of average values 

#### Min height
Minimum height of features to consider. Leave at 0 to use all features that passed the feature detection workflow 
criteria.

#### Ion identity library
Defines the ions to search. When two features, applied with two ions, result in the same neutral mass - an 
annotation is made. New ions can be defined. Adducts (left) and neutral modifications (right) are combined to create 
the final ion library. 

!!! tip
    This step should only focus on the main ions that are typically detected in the MS method. 
    Later the _Add more ion identities_ module can add strange ions to existing networks.

#### Annotation refinement _(optional)_
Annotation refinement is optional but should be applied to finalize ion identities, after all subsequent optional 
steps of _Add more ion identities_ steps. 

**Parameters:**
- _Minimum size (optional)_: Only retain ion networks with at least n ions (often 3). The more ions the higher the 
  confidence in the annotation.
- _Delete small networks without major ion (optional)_: Major ions are defined as M+H, M+Na, M+NH4, M-H2O+H
- _Delete smaller networks: Link threshold (optional)_: Important parameter to only keep the best annotation, when 
  this annotation is supported by n-1 ions (network size n). 
- _Delete networks without monomer (optional)_: Only keep a network if at least one is M+... and not a multimer like 
  2M, 3M...
- _Delete rows without ion id_: Remove all rows from the feature list that have no ion identity annotation
