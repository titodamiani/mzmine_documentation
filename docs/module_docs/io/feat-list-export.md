This module allows to export obtained feature lists to csv (comma-separated values) file format.

### **Parameters**

#### **Field separator**

Character(s) used to separate fields in the exported file. "," by default.

#### **Identification separator**

Character(s) used to separate multi object columns in the exported file. ";" by default.

#### **Remove empty columns**
_Optional parameter_

## **CSV (legacy MZmine 2)**

### **Description**

:material-menu-open: **Feature list methods → Export feature list → CSV (legacy MZmine 2)**

This module is a legacy module from MZmine2 and, similarly to the previously described module, exports the contents of the feature list(s) into a csv file, which can later be processed by MS Excel or other tools. The produced CSV files cannot be imported back to MZmine. Missing values such as heights and areas of undetected features are exported as 0.

#### **Field separator**

Columns in the new CSV file will be separated by this character (coma by default)

#### **Export common elements**

Which row elements (such as row ID, row retention time, or best ion annotation) from the feature list will be exported 

#### **Export data file elements**

Which feature elements (such as feature status, name, or tailing factor) will be exported.

#### **Export quantitation results and other information**
_Optional parameter_

If checked, all feature-associated data will be exported.

#### **Identification separator**

Character to separate multiple identification results (if they are available) for a feature. 

#### **Filter rows**

Allows user to export only those rows that have associated MS/MS data or are annotated. 

## **Export all annotations to CSV**

### **Description**

:material-menu-open: **Feature list methods → Export feature list → Export compound annotations to csv**

Export all annotations from spectral library matching, local compound DB CSV matching, and others.  
### **Parameters**

## **MSP Export**

### **Description**

:material-menu-open: **Feature list methods → Export feature list → MSP file (ADAP)**

This module exports fragmentation spectra of peaks in the feature list into **MSP** format file. In addition to the spectra, the following feature characteristics are saved into the file:

- Name
     Name of the peak as displayed in the peak list
- DB#
     Row number in the peak list
- RT 
     _Optional_
     Retention time of a feature
- ANOVA_P_VALUE (optional)
     P-value calculated by the module Data analysis -> One-way ANOVA Test
- Num Peaks
     Number of peaks in the spectrum 

### **Parameters**

#### **Feature lists**

Name of the feature list(s) to be exported

#### **Filename**
Name of file where the exported data is saved

#### **Add retention time**

If selected, each MSP record will contain feature's retention time.

#### **Add ANOVA p-value (if calculated)**

If selected, each MSP record will contain the One-way ANOVA p-value if such p-value is present

#### **Integer m/z**

If selected, fractional m/z values will be rounded to the closest integer, and a new intensity will be calculated based on the merging mode:

- Maximum: new intensity is the maximum of merged intensities,
- Sum: new intensity is the sum of merged intensities.

## **MGF Export**

### **Description**

:material-menu-open: **Feature list methods → Export feature list → MGF file (ADAP)**

This module exports fragmentation spectra of features in the feature list into **MGF (Mascot Generic Format)** format file. 

[//]: # (TODO check the additional feature characteristics info)
[//]: # (In addition to the spectra, the following feature characteristics are saved into the file:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (- FEATURE_ID )

[//]: # (     Row number in the peak list)

[//]: # (- PEPMASS)

[//]: # (     Mass of the peak. If each row in the peak list contains several peaks &#40;e.g. after performing alignment&#41;, the mass of the highest peak is chosen)

[//]: # (- RTINSECONDS)

[//]: # (     Retention time of the peak. If each row in the peak list contains several peaks, the average retention time is chosen)

[//]: # (- SCANS)

[//]: # (     The same as FEATURE_ID)

[//]: # (- MSLEVEL)

[//]: # (     Always equals 2)

[//]: # (- CHARGE)

[//]: # (     Always equals 1+)

### **Parameters**

#### **Feature lists**

Name of the feature list(s) to be exported

#### **Filename**
Name of file where the exported data is saved

#### **Representative m/z**

Choose the reprezentative m/z values of a cluster. The available options are:
- As in feature table,
- Highest m/z,
- Or maximum intensity.

#### **Fractional m/z values**
_Optional parameter_

If selected, fractional m/z values will be saved. If not, all fractional m/z values will be rounded to the closest integer.

!!! warning
     In case of rounding to integer, the corresponding features will be merged.

#### **Integer m/z**

When features are merged, the resulting elution profile is calculated by one of the following rules:
- Maximum. In the resulting elution profile, the intensity at retention time _t_ is the maximum of the intensities at _t_ across the merging elution profiles.
- Sum. In the resulting elution profile, the intensity at retention time _t_ is the sum of the intensities at _t_ for all merging elution profiles.
