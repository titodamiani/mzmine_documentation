# **<sup>13</sup>C isotope filter**

## **Description**

:material-menu-open: **Feature list methods → Isotopes → 13C isotope filter (formerly: isotope grouper)**

MZmine carries out the feature detection steps of [_chromatogram building_](../lc-ms_featdet/featdet_adap_chromatogram_builder/adap-chromatogram-builder.md) and subsequent [_resolving_](../featdet_resolver_local_minimum/local-minimum-resolver.md) considering **all** the signals stored in the [_mass lists_](../../learners_corner/terminology/general-terminology.md#mass-list). As a consequence, signals generated by isotopologues of the same chemical entity (see [_isotopic pattern_](../../learners_corner/terminology/general-terminology.md#isotopic-pattern)) are detected as distinct features and included in the [_feature lists_](../../learners_corner/terminology/general-terminology.md#feature-list), representing redundant information for the downstream data analysis. This issue ordinarily occurs for C-containing molecules, where the <sup>13</sup>C isotope signals can be easily detected (<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ≈ 1.1%).

The _13C isotope filter_ module (formerly called _Isotope grouper_) aims at filtering out the features corresponding to the <sup>13</sup>C isotopes of the same analyte. The algorithm consider each feature individually and checks for the presence of potential <sup>13</sup>C-related peak(s) in the _feature lists_. When an isotope pattern meeting the user-defined tolerances (_e.g._ _m/z_, RT) and requirements (_e.g._ _monotonic shape_) is found, the information is saved, and only the feature corresponding to the _e.g._ most intense isotope is retained in the _feature list_. It must be noted that <sup>13</sup>C peaks are searched within the _feature list_, and not in the raw data.

## **Parameters**

![13C isotope filter](isotope-filter.png)

#### **Name suffix**

String added as suffix when creating the new feature list(s).

#### **_m/z_ tolerance**

Maximum allowed difference between the measured and the predicted _m/z_ of the (potential) <sup>13</sup>C isotope to be grouped as isotopologues. The tolerance can be specified as absolute tolerance (in _m/z_), relative tolerance (in ppm), or both. When both are specified, the tolerance range is calculated using the maximum between the absolute and relative tolerances.

:material-lightbulb: We recommend to set a failry strict _m/z_ tolerance to reduce the risk of discarding false <sup>13</sup>C isotopes.

#### **Retention time tolerance**

Maximum allowed RT difference between the feature and its (potential) <sup>13</sup>C isotope to be grouped as isotopologues.

:material-lightbulb: Isotopologues should exhibit identical chromatographic behaviour and thus produce overlapping LC peak shapes. Therefore, a strict RT tolerance can be used to reduce the risk of discarding false <sup>13</sup>C isotopes.

#### **Mobility tolerance**

If enabled and the mobility dimension was recorded, potential <sup>13</sup>C isotopes will be grouped as isotopologues only if their mobility difference is within the defined tolerance.

:material-lightbulb: The same principle seen for the RT tolerance apply to the IM dimension. Isotopologues should exhibit identical IM separation; therefore, a strict mobility tolerance can be used to reduce the risk of discarding false <sup>13</sup>C isotopes.

#### **Monotonic shape**

If true, a monotonically decreasing trend of the isotope pattern (typical of the <sup>13</sup>C isotope pattern of small molecules) is required for the filtering.

#### **Maximum charge**

Maximum charge state considered to predict the <sup>13</sup>C isotopes' _m/z_. If a value > 1 is set, all the cahrge states are evaluated and the one providing the most isotope features detected is used for the filtering.

#### **Never remove feature with MS2**

If checked, potential <sup>13</sup>C-related features will not be discarded if [associated to a MS2 spectrum](../featdet_ms2_scan_pairing/ms2_scan_pairing.md).

#### **Original feature lists**

Keep or remove the input feature list(s). The _PROCESS IN PLACE_ option directly filter the input feature list and performs better in terms of memory usage; therefore, it is recommended over _REMOVE_, when available.
